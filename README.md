Assignment: create a contact us form with 4 fields with all the necessary validations, fields will be Name, Mobile Number, Email, and message, and a submit button when submit button is pressed then all the data should be sent to (info@redpositive.in as email) (you can use any third-party API for sending mail(SendGrid free), node mailer will be a plus if you use node mailer)
UI should be good, and folder structure should be good and the deadline is 24 hrs from now API implementation should be done properly make use of redux will be a bonus
